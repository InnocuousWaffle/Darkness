# Darkness
<font size=4><b>The catacombs are invaded</b></font>


## Intro
The catacombs of NTNU are flooded with filthy monsters. Armed with a tesla gun stolen from Omega, you must fight your way through the dark mazes, looking for the source of the infestation. 3D first person single player shooter.


## Characters
You play as yourself, a student at NTNU. <font size=1>Oh, and your name is probably Gordon Freeman, you study physics, and prefer crowbars over tesla guns. But no one knows that, since you never speak and there are no mirrors there.</font>


## Plot
It is late at night, and dark outside. You are alone at NTNU. You found a tesla gun left outside the Omega office. With a lingering feeling to check out the catacombs, you break open an entrance.

In the catacombs, you find a dark maze filled with hostile creatures. Light is scarce, though your tesla gun may provide some bright flashes of light.

Deep in the catacombs, you discover a secret. *insert epic boss fight here*


## Artistic style
Dark, grungy, dirty. It feels hostile, dark and dirty.
The enemies are disgusting, with repulsive looks.
Weapons are steampunk and simple.
