# Pseudocode and algoritms
This is a place to collect small snippets and ideas of how certain algoritms should work.


## Map generation
### Goal and idea
**Goal**: To create a seamless maze from the pieces in the map library.  
**Idea**:
1. Make a grid
2. Fill a random but connected path
3. Count neighbors
4. Convert cells to map pieces.


### Constraints


### Numbers
| Type | Value |
|------|-------|
| Piece size | 10 x 10 x 2.5 |
| Center | (0, 0, 0) local space |
